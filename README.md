# Getting Started

-Clone the repository to a new folder using the command `git clone (https://github.com/DARKSWAAN/phone-book`

-Install the project dependencies using the `npm install` command. This command will install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

-Start the project using the `npm run start command`.

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run start`: This command will start the development of the project and open it in the browser at http://localhost:3000 and `start` the local database http://localhost:8000.

`npm client:start`This script starts the client part of the application. Using the react-scripts package, it starts the development server and opens the app in the browser.

`npm server:start` This script runs the backend of the application using json-server, which provides a simple API to manipulate data from the db.json file.


`npm run test`: This script runs tests using the jest package and generates a coverage report.

`npm lint`: This script runs the eslint code linter on all files in the project.

`npm lint`:fix: This script runs the eslint code linter and fixes any detected problems that can be automatically fixed.

`npm eject`: This script outputs configuration settings, styles, and other settings to the project so that you can manage them without using react-scripts.
 
 
 
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm  eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
